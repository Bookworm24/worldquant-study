# WorldQuant Factor Mining Study Repository

This is my personal study repository for WorldQuant factor mining using AI-powered guided learning with iFlow. The structure is inspired by successful study methodologies for complex financial concepts.

## Repository Structure

## How This Works

This repository uses iFlow AI as an interactive WorldQuant tutor that:
- Teaches using the Socratic method (asking what you know first)
- Provides concise explanations of WorldQuant concepts
- Verifies your understanding with follow-up questions
- Adapts teaching style based on your responses
- **Tracks every learning session to personalize your study experience**

## Study Philosophy

**Guided Learning Approach:**
- Conversational and judgment-free
- Builds on your existing knowledge
- Checks understanding before moving forward
- Adapts to your learning style
- Focuses on deep understanding, not just memorization

## Key Features

**Personalized Learning**:
- Documented study sessions with detailed notes
- Socratic teaching method (builds on what you already know)
- Adaptive explanations based on your responses
- Practice problems tailored to your weak areas

**Comprehensive Tracking**:
- Every session automatically documented
- Knowledge gaps identified and tracked
- Concepts mastered with confidence levels
- Progress measured against WorldQuant learning objectives

**Evidence-Based Approach**:
- All answers verified with authoritative sources (WorldQuant documentation)
- No guessing on technical questions
- Citations provided for complex rules
- Focus on understanding "why" not just "what"
