# English Learning Study Repository

This is my personal study repository for English learning using AI-powered guided learning with iFlow. The structure is inspired by successful study methodologies for language learning, similar to the CFP-Study approach.

## Using iFlow AI for English Learning

When you interact with iFlow AI, use this approach:

3. **Request examples**: "Can you show me an example of this in practice?"
4. **Connect to other concepts**: "How does this relate to past simple tense?"
