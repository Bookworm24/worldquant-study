# WorldQuant Factor Mining Study Repository

This is my personal study repository for WorldQuant factor mining using AI-powered guided learning with iFlow. The structure is inspired by successful study methodologies for complex financial concepts, similar to the CFP-Study approach.

## Repository Structure

## How This Works

This repository uses iFlow AI as an interactive WorldQuant tutor that:
- Teaches using the Socratic method (asking what you know first)
- Provides concise explanations of WorldQuant concepts
- Verifies your understanding with follow-up questions
- Adapts teaching style based on your responses
- **Tracks every learning session to personalize your study experience**

## Getting Started

1. **Fork this repository** to your GitHub account
2. **Read the [Quick Start Guide](docs/quick-start.md)** for detailed instructions
3. **Begin learning** by interacting with iFlow AI about WorldQuant concepts
4. **Document your sessions** in the `/sessions/` directory
5. **Track your progress** using `/progress/worldquant-study-tracker.md`

## Study Philosophy

**Guided Learning Approach:**
- Conversational and judgment-free
- Builds on your existing knowledge
- Checks understanding before moving forward
- Adapts to your learning style
- Focuses on deep understanding, not just memorization

## Key Features

**Personalized Learning**:
- Documented study sessions with detailed notes
- Socratic teaching method (builds on what you already know)
- Adaptive explanations based on your responses
- Practice problems tailored to your weak areas

**Comprehensive Tracking**:
- Every session automatically documented
- Knowledge gaps identified and tracked
- Concepts mastered with confidence levels
- Progress measured against WorldQuant learning objectives

**Evidence-Based Approach**:
- All answers verified with authoritative sources (WorldQuant documentation)
- No guessing on technical questions
- Citations provided for complex rules
- Focus on understanding "why" not just "what"

## Learning Resources

- [Quick Start Guide](docs/quick-start.md) - Start here for complete setup instructions
- [Platform Overview](docs/worldquant-platform-overview.md) - Understanding WorldQuant fundamentals
- [Operators Reference](docs/operators-reference.md) - Complete list of WorldQuant operators
- [Evaluation Metrics](docs/evaluation-metrics.md) - Understanding factor assessment
- [iFlow Learning Guide](docs/iflow-learning-guide.md) - Tips for effective AI-assisted learning

## Study Schedule

The learning path is organized into phases:

### Phase 1: Fundamentals
- Understanding WorldQuant platform basics
- Learning data fields and datasets
- Basic factor construction

### Phase 2: Application
- Time-series and cross-sectional functions
- Factor optimization techniques
- Evaluation metrics interpretation

### Phase 3: Advanced
- Multi-factor models
- Risk management concepts
- Advanced factor design

## Using iFlow AI for Learning

When you interact with iFlow AI, use this approach:

1. **Ask about a concept**: "iFlow, explain the concept of Information Coefficient"
2. **Verify your understanding**: "Let me explain this back to you..."
3. **Request examples**: "Can you show me an example of this in practice?"
4. **Connect to other concepts**: "How does this relate to X?"

## Progress Tracking

Update your progress regularly in:
- `/progress/worldquant-study-tracker.md` - Overall progress
- `/sessions/YYYY-MM-DD/session-notes.md` - Daily sessions
- Identify knowledge gaps and focus areas

## Key WorldQuant Concepts

The learning covers these main areas:
- Data fields and datasets
